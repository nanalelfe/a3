Here are my enhancements: 

Images Slider: An interface aimed to make viewing the thumbnails a much more visually 
appealing venture for the end-user. Using only javascript and jquery I believe I have 
made a more user-friendly approach to viewing the thumbnails. 

Detailed Usage Instructions: Each specification comes with a comprehensive usage table. I believe my table goes beyond the requirements outlined in the specifications and offers a much more clear, in depth detailed format that can be useful to not only a developer but also the end-user. 

Drop-down list to select article index: Offers a secure way of limiting choice to only indices that match to articles accordingly. Minimizing the need for form validation on client-end. 

Responsive Design: The website works on desktop, mobiles and tablets with a different view catered to each device. 

Human readable published date: Another human readable interface add on, to give the front-end user a more convenient date format to read without having to parse the information in their heads.
